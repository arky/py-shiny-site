## Create

The best way to create a new Shiny app is with the `shiny create` command line interface (CLI). This command asks you a series of questions about what kind of app you want to create, and then provides all the boilerplate code you need to get started with a working app.

```bash
shiny create
```

### Copy/paste examples

If you find an example on this site that you want to run/edit locally, you can use `shiny create -t basic-app` to get a basic app template, and then copy/paste the code from the example into the template.

## Run

Shiny apps can be launched from VSCode, the command line (via `shiny run`), and the RStudio IDE.

### VS Code

The best way to run (and develop) Shiny apps is in [Visual Studio Code][vscode] with the [Shiny for Python extension][vscode-shiny]. When a Shiny `app.py` file is being edited, the default behavior of the Run button (circled in red in the screenshot below) becomes "Run Shiny App".

This launches a Python process in a dedicated terminal instance, and a captive web browser. This lets you test your app without leaving your editor, and whenever you make changes to your app's source, the preview will update. To preview your app in a full browser, click the icon to the right of the URL bar to launch the app in an external browser.

Next to the Run button is a dropdown menu that lets you "Debug Shiny App". This launches the app in debug mode, which lets you set breakpoints and step through your code. See the [debugging](/docs/debugging) section for more information.

### Command line

To run a Shiny app from the command line, use the `shiny run` command. This command takes a single argument, the path to the app's entry point. For example, if your app's entry point is `app.py` in the current directory, you can run it like this:

```bash
shiny run --reload app_dir/app.py
```

This should start your app and also automatically launch a web browser.

The `--reload` flag means that file changes in the current directory tree will cause the Python process to restart and the browser to reload. Update and save changes to `app.py` and then wait a moment for the changes to appear in the browser.

With these two `shiny` commands, you now have a project that you can run in your terminal. You can use any text editor or Python IDE to write Shiny apps, but we've taken special care to ensure a smooth workflow for [Visual Studio Code][vscode]. The next section will help you set up VS Code for Shiny for Python.

## RStudio IDE

::: callout-note
RStudio IDE integration is currently a work in progress.
:::

To run a Shiny application from the RStudio IDE, click on "Tools" in the menu bar.
Then, select "Terminal" followed by "New Terminal".
This will open a terminal tab next to your R console.

In the terminal pane, enter the commands from the "Running with the shiny CLI" section:

```sh
shiny run --reload my_app/app.py
```
