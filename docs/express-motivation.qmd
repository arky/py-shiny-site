This article covers the difference, overlap, and translation between _Express_ and _Core_ apps.
As the name suggests, Express is a simpler way to learn and write Shiny apps, but it's also more limited.
As a result, we recommend Express for learning and simple apps, but Core for more serious projects that require more flexibility and [modularity](modules.qmd).

### Why might I switch? {#why-switch}

There are a few reasons you might want to switch from Express to Core:

* Redirecting outputs (big plot functions -- git diff)
* Decoupling helps with refactoring UI
* Programming with UI
  - Imperative vs functional
* Code organization
  - Express is easier to write, but harder to read
* Modules
* Understanding lifecycle
* Session state
